# Alstom-Spark-Cassandra

Proof of concept for my internship at Alstom in 2020.
The objective was to code the queries to reconstruct a message from its individial fields.
The difficulty lies in the fact that only the updates of the fields are kept.

Connects Spark and Cassandra to generate and fetch messages in the database.
I started coding in Scala but then switched to Java to make the integration into the Java app easier.
